The WFDB Application Toolbox for MATLAB is a collection of open-source MATLAB/Octave functions for reading, writing, and processing physiological time series data. The toolbox is implemented as a series of Java system calls to the WFDB Software applications (http://physionet.org/physiotools/wag/wag.htm).

Using the WFDB Toolbox, MATLAB/Octave users have direct access to over 50 PhysioBank databases (over 3 TB of physiologic signals including ECG, EEG, EMG, fetal ECG, PLETH, ABP, and more). Additionally, most of these databases are also accompanied by meta-data such as expert annotations of physiologically relevant events (WFDB annotation files). These can include, for example, cardiologist annotations on ECGs for classifying different arrhythmia, or sleep expert annotations on EEG for segmenting different sleep stages. All of these physiologic signals and annotations can be read on demand from the PhysioNet web server and its mirrors using the toolbox functions, or from local copies if you choose to download them.
